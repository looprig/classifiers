// Package prompt holds the immutable system prompt for the gate.command-safety

// runtime: its exact bytes are the classifier's identity-relevant policy text,
// folded into hustle definition identity via hustle.WithSystemPrompt, and
// never crosses this module's public boundary directly (see
// docs/plans/2026-07-27-permission-classifier-hustle-design.md §19.2).
