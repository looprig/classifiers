// This file implements Harness's optional tool.EvidenceObservation
// capability (design §13.4, TOCTOU — see
// github.com/looprig/harness-permission-classifier's
// docs/plans/2026-07-27-permission-classifier-hustle-implementation.md,
// Addendum 4) for the two evidence tools in this package that genuinely
// resolve and report the state of ONE canonical target:
//
//   - evidence_filesystem_stat (pathStatTool): the flagship case — it
//     already exists specifically to report one path's lstat-level identity.
//   - evidence_filesystem_read (readFileTool): reads exactly one file's
//     bytes; the file it read is exactly as single-target as the path stat
//     already reports on.
//
// Every OTHER evidence tool in this package is deliberately left
// unimplemented:
//
//   - evidence_filesystem_list, evidence_filesystem_glob,
//     evidence_filesystem_grep: each reports on a VARIABLE-SIZE set of
//     matched/listed entries under one starting directory, not one target's
//     own canonical identity — recording an observation for "the directory
//     listing" or "the grep match set" does not map to "one target's
//     canonical identity, then and now" the way design §13.4 means it
//     (this is the addendum's own explicit exclusion for glob/grep-style
//     multi-match tools, applied identically to list).
//   - evidence_git_repository_status, evidence_git_remotes: both report
//     aggregate, whole-repository state (status across every changed path,
//     every configured remote) — the same "spans many things, not one
//     canonical target" shape as list/glob/grep, not a single resolved
//     ref/path.
//   - evidence_git_diff, evidence_git_branch: each DOES resolve something
//     that could naturally be target-sensitive (a ref-scoped diff, HEAD's
//     resolved branch/commit). They are still deliberately NOT wired here:
//     tool.Requirement's own doc comment reserves Match for "stored-rule
//     matching" and Scope for "access routing" — neither is a general
//     carrier for the extra structured data (git diff's ref/staged flag;
//     which specific ref branch resolution used) an observation token would
//     need to be self-describing from Target alone. Repurposing either
//     field, or overloading Request.Command (meant for command-backed
//     capabilities) to smuggle that data through, would risk silently
//     breaking whatever already depends on their documented contracts.
//     Giving Git evidence tools a real, precisely-specified target/token
//     scheme needs a small, deliberate carrier added to tool.Requirement (or
//     an equivalent), which is a Harness-side change — a follow-up dispatch,
//     not a tuck-in here. (When that lands, prefer the resolved commit/blob
//     SHA `git rev-parse` already gives as the token: it is naturally
//     content-addressed, and design §13.4 explicitly prefers reusing that
//     over inventing a weaker derived one.)
//
// ---- token derivation scheme (read this before changing anything below) --
//
// Both wired tools share ONE token FORMULA, implemented by
// fingerprintFields/fingerprintAbsentFields below: a SHA-256 over the
// target path's lstat-level identity (never following the final symlink)
// plus, only when the path IS itself a symlink, its immediate link-target
// text and the link target's own resolved metadata (when the link resolves
// at all). This directly captures "whether the path is/was a symlink and
// what it resolves to" — the exact signal design §13.4's own worked example
// (a deletion target being swapped for a symlink between evidence-gathering
// and auto-approval) requires; a token that omitted it would not defend
// against the attack this mechanism exists to close.
//
// filesystemObservationFingerprint(root, rel) performs this formula against
// a FRESH Lstat/Readlink/Stat lookup of its own, and is what readFileTool's
// captureObservation uses (its own internal read syscalls don't produce an
// Lstat-based result to reuse). pathStatTool instead calls
// fingerprintFields/fingerprintAbsentFields DIRECTLY from InvokableRun,
// reusing the exact Lstat/Readlink/Stat results it already computed to
// build its own model-visible text — the same formula, zero additional
// filesystem calls. Either way, the token is captured synchronously inside
// InvokableRun (via observationCapture, see below) and never re-derived
// later from ObservedRequirement — see fingerprintFields's own doc comment
// for why that distinction is the actual TOCTOU fix this file implements.
//
// Concretely, for a target that EXISTS, the hashed field sequence (via
// observationDigest, see its own doc comment for the exact wire encoding)
// is:
//
//	"fsv1", "present",
//	<lstat fields: entryKind, decimal size, decimal raw os.FileMode bits,
//	 decimal UnixNano mtime>,
//	then, ONLY if the lstat entry is itself a symlink, one of:
//	  "link_target", <raw readlink() text>, "link_resolved",
//	    <resolved-target lstat fields, same 4-tuple as above>
//	  "link_target_absent"        (link target does not exist)
//	  "link_target_unresolvable"  (link target could not be resolved —
//	                                e.g. it escapes containment)
//	  "link_unreadable"           (readlink itself failed)
//
// For a target that does NOT exist, the hashed sequence is just
// "fsv1", "absent" — deliberately not "no observation" (ok=false): a
// classifier that observed "this deletion target does not exist" IS making
// a real, TOCTOU-relevant observation (design's own worked example), so
// absence must produce a real, valid token, not a skip.
//
// "fsv1" is a fixed scheme-version literal: change it (to "fsv2", etc.)
// whenever the field list, order, or format below changes, so an old
// recorded token can never silently compare equal to a new one computed
// under a different scheme.
//
// entryKind, decimal size/mode/mtime are computed EXACTLY as
// entryKind/fileInfoFingerprintFields below do — see those for the precise
// formulas (Go's os.FileInfo.Size()/Mode()/ModTime(), no reformatting).
//
// HOW TO INDEPENDENTLY RE-DERIVE THIS TOKEN (for the CodeRig-side
// gate.EvidenceObservationVerifier that rechecks it against a fresh look):
// call filesystemObservationFingerprint with root = the verifier's own
// canonicalized read root (gate.EvidenceContainmentPolicy's ReadRoot — or,
// equivalently, treat the recorded Target as already-absolute: it always
// equals filepath.Join(root, rel), so root can also be recovered as
// Target's directory chain up to the policy's own ReadRoot) and rel = the
// path relative to that root. Re-running the identical algorithm against
// live filesystem state and comparing the resulting hex digest to the
// recorded Token IS the recheck — no other data is required, and none of
// this format depends on anything ephemeral to one particular tool call
// (there is no offset/limit/content dependency: see readFileTool's
// ObservedRequirement doc comment below for why).

// filesystemObservationFingerprint computes the token described above for
// one root-relative path by performing its own fresh Lstat/Readlink/Stat
// lookups. It is the SOLE token FORMULA for every tool.EvidenceObservation
// implementation in this file — pathStatTool and readFileTool ultimately
// produce a token via the exact same field sequence, so a target's
// fingerprint means the same thing regardless of which tool observed it —
// but it is deliberately NOT how pathStatTool captures its own observation
// (see fingerprintFields's doc comment for why performing a fresh lookup
// here would reopen the TOCTOU gap this whole mechanism exists to close).
// It remains the right tool for readFileTool, whose own internal read
// syscalls (Open, which follows symlinks, then Stat on the open file
// descriptor) do not themselves compute an Lstat-based result to reuse; see
// readFileTool's own ObservedRequirement doc comment.
